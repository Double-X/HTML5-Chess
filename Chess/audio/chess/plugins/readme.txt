This folder's for plugin developers to place audio files just in case they need such a place.
Plugin developers should put all their audio files in folders named by the plugin names and place them here.
All audio files here are supposed to be used by Chess plugins only.
All audio files are supposed to be loaded by js files(directly and/or via json files) rather than the html file.
