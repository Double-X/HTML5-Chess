Every plugin should consist of the following 6 modules:

Declaration(Mandatory) - Declares the existence of the plugin, its modules, and all the required plugins
The declaration module's located in plugins/declarations

API(Optional) - Defines the exposed functionality that are supposed to be used by other plugins and as script calls
Script calls are simply functionalities that can be executed in the browser console
If some/all of the exposed functionalities are supposed to have any/all of the below intended uses:
1. Plugin configuration values(e.g.: for configurations that are customizable javascript functions)
2. Script calls
Please explicitly states so
The API module's located in plugins/apis

Configuration(Optional) - Lets users configure the plugin in ways controlled by the plugin itself
The configuration module's located in plugins/configurations

Implementation(Mandatory) - Implements the plugin functionalities and connect the plugin with the existing js files
The implementation module's located in plugins/implementations

Unit Test(Optional) - Implements the plugin implementation unit test suite
The unit test module's located in plugins/unitTests

Compatibility(Optional) - Implements patches for compatibility issues with some other plugins that aren't required
by the current one
The compatibility module's located in plugins/compatibilities

For any plugin, the module loading order's the following:
1. Declaration
2. API
3. Configuration
4. Implementation
5. Unit Test
6. Compatibility

Each module should clearly states where the file should be placed, so plugin users can still place them right in 
case they've messed up with the installation steps

===================================================================================================================

Also, albeit being optional, every plugin should have its own readme file to help users use the plugin
For instance, it should include a changelog and state which modules must be loaded and which are optional, and
which plugins are required by this plugin(please state whether they're needed for some or all functionalities)
Another good example is to instruct users how to stop the unit test module, if any, when it causes too much lag
Lacking such instructions will likely cause users to assume all modules must be loaded
The readme file's supposed to be located in folder docs/manuals/.../plugins
... should be replaced by abstractChess/chess/chineseChess for Abstract Chess/Chess/Chinese Chess plugins

For any plugin including diagrams, you're supposed to store them in a folder named by the plugin name, and place 
that folder in docs/diagrams/.../plugins
... should be replaced by abstractChess/chess/chineseChess for Abstract Chess/Chess/Chinese Chess plugins

Finally, every plugin should be zipped it can just be unzipped at the Chess(root) folder to complete its setup
