There's a rather rare bug(1 out of 10 on average) that will cause some plugins to at least partially malfunction.
To check whether this happens, please always open the console when playing to see if there are error messages.
If this does happen, please refresh until the error's gone. Refreshing once should be enough in most cases.

While I've pinpointed the apparent cause of the bug(some of the plugin components can't see the declaration even
after the latter's loaded), I've yet to found its root cause nor how to fix the bug without knowing the root cause.
I'll continue to try until the issue's fixed. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.
