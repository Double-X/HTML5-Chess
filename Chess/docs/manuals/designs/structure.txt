The procedure of moving a piece's usually as follows:
1. A location in a chessboard's selected
2. If the location doesn't have a piece or the piece isn't owned by the currently movable side, simply select the
   location, otherwise select the piece
3. Another location in a chessboard's selected
4. If no piece's previously selected, goes to step 2, otherwise try to move that previously selected piece to the
   located selected in step 3
5. If that piece can move to that location, then does so, otherwise state why the movement can't take place
6. If that movement can take place and that location has a piece on the opposite side, then capture that piece
7. If that successful movement lead to at least 1 piece checking the opposite general, then state them all
8. Unselects that piece and change the currently movable side to the opposite side, then goes to step 1
The whole procedure applies to both Chess and Chinese Chess, possibly with a slight exception for Castling in Chess

As all core modules are to implement behaviors and named by abilities, the aforementioned procedures lead to these:
1. Selectable - All locations in a chessboard can be selected, thus the functionalities of selecting selectables
                need to be implemented
                The same implementation applies to both Chess and Chinese Chess
2. Highlightable - In order for players to know which selectable's selected, the selected one needs to be
                   highlighted, meaning that the functionalities of highlighting highlightables need to be
                   implemented
                   The same implementation applies to both Chess and Chinese Chess
3. Movable - Any piece can be moved if it currently exists at least 1 movement conforming to all movement rules, so
             the functionalieies of moving movables need to be implemented
             The same implementation applies to both Chess and Chinese Chess
4. Movable rules - As mentioned, in order for a movable to be able to move, it needs to have at least 1 movement
                   conforming to all movement rules, so the functionalities of checking those rules need to be
                   implemented
                   Chess and Chinese Chess need different implementations due to them having different pieces with
                   different movement rules
5. Coordinates - As whether movable rules are conformed largely depends on the coordinates of the current location
                 and destination of a piece to be moved, the functionalities of accessing the coordinates of a 
                 location needs to be implemented
                 The same implementation applies to both Chess and Chinese Chess
6. Capture - Moving a piece can mean capturing another piece on the opposite side, so the functionalities of
             capturing a piece need to be implemented
             The same implementation applies to both Chess and Chinese Chess
7. Checkable - Moving a piece can lead to checking the opposite general, so the functionalities of checking a
               checkable needs to be implemented
               The same implementation applies to both Chess and Chinese Chess
8. Current Side - As only the current side can move any of its piece and doing so will change the current side to
                  the opposite side, the functionalities of accessing the current side need to be implemented
                  The same implementation applies to both Chess and Chinese Chess
