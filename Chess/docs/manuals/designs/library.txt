Library files are similar to plugin files, except that:
1. Plugins depend on the core modules, which depend on libraries, if any
2. Plugins are part of this project while libraries are externally reusable files used by this project
3. Plugins are loaded via pluginLoader.js while libraries are loaded by the HTML files directly

While this project doesn't need any library to work, core module developers are free to:
1. Use any external library for any core module development, as long as all its terms of use are conformed and all
   credits are provided in credits.txt(unless it violates any of the former)
2. Extract any core module functionality that are reusable outside this project into libraries
