Some plugins might need to run some codes upon starting the game, and some might need to stop some of the former
from happeneing. For instance, this might happen when there are compatibility issues.

Besides, my experiments shows that, running setup codes immediately upon loading the plugin owning them will lead
to a rare bug causing some plugins to fail to read some files that are already loaded.

Therefore, a container's needed to store all the requested setup codes by all plugins.
The container's a mapping from a plugin name to its list of functions as setup codes.
To request some setup codes to be run, wrap them up into functions taking no arguments and put those functions into
the list mapped from the plugin name in the container.

To remove some setup codes from some plugins, simply remove them from the lists mapped by the names of those
plugins in the container.
Note that all setup codes of all Abstract Chess pluginsd are run right before running all those of all concrete
ones.
It means that:
1. For a concrete chess plugin to remove some setup codes of some Abstract Chess plugin, it can only be done right
   upon loading the former plugin.
2. For the opposite case, it can only be one in some setup codes of those Abstract Chess plugins.

Please check the timer and gameRecord plugins as examples.
