Each core module's designed to implement the necessary behaviors, that's why most of them are named by abilities.

The core modules(those in folder abstractChess, chess, chineseChess) only implements the essential functionalities,
and all the optional ones are implemented by plugins that can be activated/deactivated ob the fly.

This approach keeps the codebase easy, simple and small for both the core module developers and plugin developers.
To achieve this, each function in the core modules are designed as hooks that can be extended by plugins.

On the other hand, each API of the core modules are supposed to be stable seams that are not meant to be extended.
