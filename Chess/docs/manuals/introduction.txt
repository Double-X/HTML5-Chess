This's an experimental side project serving as an environment for learning how to use Javascript ES5 to manipulate
HTML5 DOM with the aid of CSS, AJAX, unit test, integration test and as few third party frameworks as possible.

The goal of this project itself's to become an easy, simple and small framework for implementing Chess and Chinese
Chess in ways that are extensible, maintainable and performant.

While it's not a serious project due to me only having 1 year of Javascript experience, I'll still try to set the 
quality bar as high as I still think I can surpass it. The quality bar of contributors will be as low as I and all
the other involved contributors can still tolerate it.

Anyone's welcome to comment on, contribute to and use this project, as long as the license's not breached.

Credits will be given to all those advertised, contributed to, and used this projects, in ways agreed by all the
involved stakeholders. Such agreements will be come up on a case-by-case and/or stakeholder-by-stakeholder basis.
