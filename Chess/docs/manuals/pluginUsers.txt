Every plugin consists of the following 2 modules that are supposed to be used by users:

API(Optional) - If it exists, it might let users to use some/all of the exposed functionalities as script calls
To use a script call, simply type it in the browser console, if any, and executes it
Sometimes some APIs can also be used in plugin configuration values(e.g.: for customizable javascript functions)
The API module's located in plugins/apis

Configuration(Optional) - If it exists, it lets users configure the plugin in ways controlled by the plugin itself
The configuration module's located in plugins/configurations

To load an Abstract Chess/Chess/Chinese Chess plugin, open plugins.js in folder abstractChess/chess/chineseChess
DON'T TOUCH plugins.js in FOLDER plugins UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRULY DOING!
For any plugin, its declaration and implementation modules must be loaded in order for that plugin to work.
If that plugin has instructions on which of the remainings are optional/mandatory, then just follow them.
If there's no such instructions, then simply load all modules.
If a plugin has instructions on which plugins are required, please follow so.
Also, please note that if a plugin requires some other ones, then the former should be loaded after loading the
latters. This's done by placing the former below all the latters in the aforementioned plugins.js to be touched.
DON'T TOUCH ANY OTHER PARTS OF THAT plugins.js FILE UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRULY DOING!
DON'T TOUCH ANY OTHER js FILES UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRULY DOING!
